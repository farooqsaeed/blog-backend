Node.js Blog Backend
This repository contains a robust and secure backend application for a blog built using Node.js. The backend implements user management, post creation, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and adheres to the principles of SOLID design.

Features
User Management: Create, update, and delete user accounts. Utilize user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive endpoints.
Post Creation: Enable users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. Store and retrieve post information from a database.
JWT Authentication: Implement secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Generate and validate tokens to protect routes and ensure authorized access.
MVC Architecture: Follow the Model-View-Controller pattern to achieve separation of concerns and maintain a scalable and maintainable codebase.
SOLID Principles: Adhere to the principles of SOLID design (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to write clean, modular, and extensible code.
